 This file implements some commonly used argument matchers.  More
 matchers can be defined by the user implementing the
 MatcherInterface<T> interface if necessary.

 This header file defines the public API for Google Test.  It should be

 IMPORTANT NOTE: Due to limitation of the C++ language, we have to
 leave some internal implementation details in this header file.
 They are clearly marked by comments like this:

 A sample program demonstrating using Google C++ testing framework.
 .
 In this example, we use a more advanced feature of Google Test called
 test fixture.
 .
 A test fixture is a place to hold objects and functions shared by
 all tests in a test case.  Using a test fixture avoids duplicating
 the test code necessary to initialize and cleanup those common
 objects for each test.  It is also useful for defining sub-routines
 that your tests need to invoke a lot.
 .
 <TechnicalDetails>
 .
 The tests share the test fixture in the sense of code sharing, not
 data sharing.  Each test is given its own fresh copy of the
 fixture.  You cannot expect the data modified by one test to be
 passed on to another test, which is a bad idea.
 .
 The reason for this design is that tests should be independent and
 repeatable.  In particular, a test should not fail as the result of
 another test's failure.  If one test depends on info produced by
 another test, then the two tests should really be one big test.
 .
 The macros for indicating the success/failure of a test

 Each TEST() expands to some static registration logic.  GCC puts all
 such static initialization logic for a translation unit in a common,
 internal function.  Since Google's build system restricts how much
 stack space a function can use, there's a limit on how many TEST()s
 one can put in a single C++ test file.  This test ensures that a large
 number of TEST()s can be defined in the same translation unit.

 A sample program demonstrating using Google C++ testing framework.
 .
 This sample shows how to write a more complex unit test for a class
 that has multiple member functions.
 .
 Usually, it's a good idea to have one test for each method in your
 class.  You don't have to do that exactly, but it helps to keep
 your tests organized.  You may also throw in additional tests as
 needed.

 This sample shows how to write a simple unit test for a function,
 using Google C++ testing framework.
 .
 Writing a unit test using Google C++ testing framework is easy as 1-2-3:
 .
 Step 1. Include necessary header files such that the stuff your
 test logic needs is declared.
 .
 Don't forget gtest.h, which declares the testing framework.

 This sample teaches how to reuse a test fixture in multiple test
 cases by deriving sub-fixtures from it.
 .
 When you define a test fixture, you specify the name of the test
 case that will use this fixture.  Therefore, a test fixture can
 be used by only one test case.
 .
 Sometimes, more than one test cases may want to use the same or
 slightly different test fixtures.  For example, you may want to
 make sure that all tests for a GUI library don't leak important
 system resources like fonts and brushes.  In Google Test, you do
 this by putting the shared logic in a super (as in "super class")
 test fixture, and then have each test case use a fixture derived
 from this super fixture.

 Google Mock - a framework for writing C++ mock classes.
 .
 This file tests that:
 a. A header file defining a mock class can be included in multiple
 translation units without causing a link error.
 b. Actions and matchers can be instantiated with identical template
 arguments in different translation units without causing link
 errors.
 The following constructs are currently tested:
 Actions:
 Return()
 Return(value)
 ReturnNull
 ReturnRef
 Assign
 SetArgPointee
 SetArrayArgument
 SetErrnoAndReturn
 Invoke(function)
 Invoke(object, method)
 InvokeWithoutArgs(function)
 InvokeWithoutArgs(object, method)
 InvokeArgument
 WithArg
 WithArgs
 WithoutArgs
 DoAll
 DoDefault
 IgnoreResult
 Throw
 ACTION()-generated
